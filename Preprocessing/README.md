## Text Augmentation
    The augmentation module helps you to generate new texts based on your given examples by modifying some words in the initial ones and to keep associated entities unchanged, if any, in the case of NER tasks. If you want words other than entities to remain unchanged, you can specify it within the stopwords argument. Modifications depend on the chosen method, the ones currently supported by the module are substitutions with synonyms using Wordnet or BERT from the nlpaug library.
## Usage
