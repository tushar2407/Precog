# Naive Bayes Algorithm

- It works on the formula of Bayes Theorem which is stated as follows:
    
    P(A|B) = P(B|A)P(A)/P(B)

    - can be read as Probability of ocurrence of A given B is equal to Probability of occurence of B given A into Probability of A divided by Probability of B.

`Naive Bayes` is so called as it calculates the conditional probability for each feature and returns one with the maximum probability.
